# Spam-Mail-Prediction

A machine learning model/web app that classifies emails as *spam* or *not spam* (ham) based on their content and metadata.

## üéØ Project Overview  
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning classifier to predict whether a given email is spam. It‚Äôs intended for learning and prototyping, and should **not** be used as a production‚Äêgrade filtering system.

## ‚úÖ Features  
- Accepts raw email text (subject + body) as input  
- Preprocesses text (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, vectorization)  
- Trains a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)  
- Outputs a probability/risk score and a label (Spam / Ham)  
- (Optional) Simple UI or command-line interface for users  
- (Optional) Model evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

## üß∞ Tech Stack  
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, (optionally) NLTK / spaCy  
- Vectorization: CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer  
- Classifier: e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression  
- (Optional) Web framework: Flask / Streamlit for UI  
- Dataset: Public spam email dataset (e.g., from Kaggle)  

## üîß Installation & Setup  
```bash
